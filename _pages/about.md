Hi there and welcome to my website!
My name pronounces as Joo-young, with 'Joo' as in zoo and 'young' as in [we are young](https://youtu.be/Sv6dMFF_yts?feature=shared). You can call me Julie (my starbucks name) if you'd prefer.

My primary research field is on Econometric Theory, where I've mostly done research on big data/ machine learning topics. My **job market paper** is on impulse response analysis with high-dimensional covariates. Click **[here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zDoOTL6MqoVcN1KEJhjs2qlXNwv6x_vh/view?usp=sharing)** for the latest version of my job market paper! I'm also enthusiastic about topics on causal inferences.
